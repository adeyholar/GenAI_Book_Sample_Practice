# Deep Learning for Coders - Reading Progress

## Overview
This repository tracks my progress through *Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch* by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger as part of the Generative AI Engineering Fellowship (June 2025 - December 2025). The goal is to log key takeaways, code experiments, and reflections, connecting concepts to my capstone project (e.g., AI agent for network management, NGO website optimization, or farm operations). This supports my learning in Python, NLP, RAG, and multimodal AI, as outlined in the fellowship schedule.

## Repository Structure
- **/notes/**: Markdown files for chapter summaries and reflections (e.g., `chapter_1.md`).
- **/code/**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for fastai/PyTorch exercises (e.g., `ch1_image_classifier.ipynb`).
- **/capstone/**: Ideas and experiments linking book concepts to my capstone (e.g., image classification for NGO website SEO or farm crop health).
- **/resources/**: Links to fellowship materials, fastai docs, or Python refreshers (Base Camp 2, June 14-15, 2025).

## Setup Instructions
To run the code examples or replicate the environment:
1. **Install Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is set up (refer to fellowship Base Camp 1, June 8, 2025).
2. **Set Up fastai and PyTorch**:
   - Install fastai: `pip install fastai`
   - Install PyTorch: Follow [PyTorch's official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for your system.
   - Optional: Use Google Colab or Jupyter Lab for cloud-based experiments (Base Camp 1).
3. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deep-learning-coders-progress
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (includes fastai, torch, jupyter, numpy, pandas).
5. **Run Notebooks**:
   - Open Jupyter Lab: `jupyter lab`
   - Navigate to `/code/` and run notebooks like `ch1_image_classifier.ipynb`.

## How to Use
- **Track Progress**: Update `/notes/` with chapter summaries (e.g., key fastai workflow from Chapter 1).
- **Run Experiments**: Add code to `/code/` for book exercises (e.g., train a model on a custom dataset).
- **Capstone Ideas**: Log applications in `/capstone/` (e.g., use Chapter 1â€™s image classifier for farm crop analysis).
- **Collaborate**: Share insights with the fellowship community via pull requests or discussions.

## Capstone Connections
This repository links book concepts to my capstone project:
- **Network Management**: Use deep learning for log classification or anomaly detection.
- **NGO Website**: Apply image classification for SEO or content categorization.
- **Farm Operations**: Build models to analyze crop health from images or sensor data.
